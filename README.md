# Poker-Project

Personal Project for fun.
Poker game simulator with 2-6 players (1-5 CPU players)
Single Player mode only.

## How-to:

Install Python3 on your machine
Make sure you are in the directory with pokerGUI.py
Run `python3 pokerGUI.py`

## Notes:

- 2023/09/13 - 2023/09/16: Basics of game complete. Single player vs 1-5 CPU players. CPU always calls the bet. Game ends if user is the last player left or if the player runs out of chips.

## Future Improvement Ideas

- Continued testing for finding bugs
- Implementing logic for when the winner goes all in.
- Improve the text base display
- Add GUI on pygames for improved user interface
- Improve CPU
- Assistance (win probability calculator)
- Organize code
